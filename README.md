# TweetTweet 




The objective of TweetTweet is simple: Create a similar twitter with our own touch on it; making it unique yet still just as functional! This 'app' is similar to twitter in that the goal is to 1. Login, 2. Post something on our mind, 3. Be able to use hashtags, and 4. be able to search certain things in a search bar and of course, 5. Logout once finished. We will continue to add our own ideas as we progress.
